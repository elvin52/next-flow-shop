# Blog Website Pre-Production Checklist

## Content Quality & User Experience (UX)

### Content Quality
- [x] **High-Quality, Original Content**: All articles are well-researched, well-written, and provide unique value not found on other sites. Avoid thin or auto-generated content.
- [x] **Proofread and Edited**: Content is free of spelling and grammatical errors. It's clear, concise, and easy to read.

### Formatting
- [x] **Proper Formatting**:
  - [x] Content is broken up with headings (H2, H3, etc.) for easy scanning.
  - [x] Use of short paragraphs, bullet points, and numbered lists.
  - [x] Key points are bolded or italicized for emphasis.

### Visual & UX
- [ ] **Visual Appeal**: Every post includes relevant, high-quality images, screenshots, infographics, or videos to improve engagement.
- [x] **"Above the Fold" Impact**: The first screen a user sees immediately communicates the site's topic and value proposition.
- [x] **Clear Navigation**: Easy-to-use menu with logical structure (e.g., Home, Blog, Categories, About, Contact).
- [x] **Mobile-Responsive Design**: The blog is perfectly readable and usable on all device sizes (phones, tablets, desktop).

### Trust Pages
- [x] **Legitimate "About" and "Contact" Pages**: These pages build trust with both users and search engines.
- [x] **Privacy Policy & Terms Pages**: Essential for GDPR/legal compliance, especially if you have any user data collection (e.g., comments, email signups).

## Technical Performance & Core Web Vitals

### Performance Metrics
- [ ] **Fast Loading Speed**: Aim for Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) under 2.5 seconds. Test with tools like PageSpeed Insights and GTmetrix.
- [ ] **Optimized Images**: All images are compressed (e.g., using WebP format) and appropriately sized for their container (e.g., not using a 2000px wide image for a 400px column).
- [ ] **Minimized Code**: CSS and JavaScript files are minified and combined where possible.
- [x] **Efficient Hosting**: The blog is hosted on a reliable, fast server (e.g., Vercel, Netlify, a quality shared/VPS provider).
- [ ] **Low Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS)**: Under 0.1. Ensure images and ads have defined dimensions (width and height attributes) to prevent annoying layout jumps.
- [ ] **Good Interaction to Next Paint (INP)**: Under 200 milliseconds. This means the site feels responsive to clicks and taps.

## On-Page & Technical SEO

### Meta Tags & URLs
- [x] **Keyword-Targeted Page Titles (<title> tag)**: Unique, compelling, and include the primary keyword for each post (ideally at the beginning). Keep under 60 characters.
- [x] **Compelling Meta Descriptions**: A unique, persuasive summary for each page that includes the keyword. Acts as ad copy in search results. Keep under 160 characters.
- [x] **Descriptive URL Slugs**: Clean, readable URLs (e.g., yoursite.com/blog/seo-checklist instead of yoursite.com/p=123).

### Content Structure
- [x] **Proper Heading Hierarchy**: Use one H1 tag per page (the post title), followed by H2s, H3s, etc., to structure content logically.
- [ ] **Image SEO**: All images have descriptive alt text that includes context and keywords where natural.
- [ ] **Internal Linking**: Articles link to other relevant articles on your own blog to keep users engaged and spread "link equity."

### Technical SEO
- [ ] **XML Sitemap**: A sitemap.xml file exists and is submitted to Google Search Console. It lists all important, indexable URLs.
- [x] **robots.txt File**: A robots.txt file exists at the root and correctly instructs crawlers on what they can and cannot access.
- [x] **SSL Certificate**: The site is served over HTTPS (a security and ranking factor).
- [x] **Schema Markup**: Implement basic schemas like Article, BlogPosting, Organization, and BreadcrumbList to enhance search results with rich snippets.

## Pre-Launch Final Checks

### Browser & Functionality Testing
- [ ] **Test on Multiple Browsers**: Check functionality on Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge.
- [ ] **Check All Links**: Ensure all internal and external links work correctly (no 404 errors). Use a tool like Screaming Frog (free for 500 URLs) or a broken link checker extension.

### Analytics & Tracking
- [ ] **Set Up Analytics**: Google Analytics 4 (GA4) is installed and tracking correctly.
- [ ] **Set Up Search Console**: Google Search Console is verified and connected to your site. Submit your sitemap here after launch.

### Final Polish
- [ ] **Favicon**: A custom favicon is uploaded and displays correctly in the browser tab.
- [x] **Social Sharing Ready**: When a post URL is shared on Facebook, LinkedIn, etc., it pulls in the correct title, description, and image (using Open Graph tags).
